# TODO — what Dafman doesn't ship yet

> One file. Every open feature, gap, and known piece of tech debt,
> organized by topic and ranked within each topic.
>
> When you ship something: move it from here to [`DONE.md`](DONE.md).
> When the design is unclear, open a short spec interview (per AGENTS.md
> rule 9) — *don't* spawn another plan file.
>
> Last refreshed 2026-05-27 (post Groups v3.1).

Legend:

- 🟦 partial — core shipped, sub-feature missing
- 🟨 started — design exists, scaffolding shipped, not user-visible
- ⬜ not started
- ⏳ blocked on upstream

## By User (unsorted)

- The instructions markdown doesn't support darkmode
- The instructions should support creating and editing
- No refresh button on library agents
- Library agents doesn't show project agents
- MCP creator doesn't let you choose between user or project
- MCP creator is a modal, but agent creator is inline
- Many tools (especially sub-agent related one such as task, read agent, report_intent, powershell, ask_user (After the ask - in history)) don't have nice ui
- I think we should use the library to set mcp/tools/skills/agents/instructions things for the session, instead of duplicating it with the session settings (need to think about design)
- Sessions may resume with the agent "thinking..." and never get resolved
- Bottom bar resizing is ruined again, probably because you brought the modes icon back, but not the small select version on small sizes
- Background tasks in sessions looks worse and is less useful than library
- Collpased menus, in general, should use the space to display something useful
- Probably need chip + selector for agent in the bottom bar
- 

## Top of stack (recommended next sprints)

Ranked by **(frequency-of-mention) × (user-visible impact) × (clear scope)**:

1. ⬜ **Configurable shortcut system** — user-flagged as the next priority after palette polish
2. ⬜ **GitHub `#` mentions + Issues/PRs/Gists Library tabs** (G1) — small, leverages existing `MentionPlugin`
3. ⬜ **Diff viewer: accept/reject hunks** — `ApplyPatchView.vue` is view-only today
4. ⬜ **Multi-account + BYOK** (OS-keyring) — internal demand
5. ⬜ **Projects model** — per-cwd settings overlay; unblocks per-session MCP overlay + per-project autopilot policy
6. ⬜ **Plans API rendering panel** — SDK `rpc.plan.*` exists; no panel
7. ⬜ **Memory backend** (SQLite-vec or LanceDB)
8. ⬜ **Automations + scheduler** + HTTP hooks
9. ⬜ **Cmd palette prefix syntax** (deferred from polish sprint — sub-menus + settings coverage shipped 2026-05-27)
10. ⬜ **Real-Electrobun (CDP) harness, Tier-4** — drive the actual WebView2/WKWebView binary. Hard (no CDP debug ports exposed by default) and Tier-3 extension shipped 2026-05-27 already catches the v3 bug class; downranked.

## Shell & layout

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Real-Electrobun (Tier-4) CDP harness | ⬜ | ~3 d | Drive the actual built binary via CDP. Hard — webviews don't expose debug ports by default. Tier-3 extensions (flows 21–24) already cover the v3 restart-restore bug class. |
| 2 | Outer-fromJSON vs Vue unmount race | ⬜ | 0.5 d | Deferred from Groups v3 code review |
| 3 | Lazy-mount placeholder for unfocused groups | ⬜ | 1 d | Groups v3.1 (G4d) |
| 4 | Manual test pass on real data | ⬜ | user | Restore fix `c97b0a5` unblocks |
| 5 | Tiling / layout commands (split / stack / focus-by-direction) | 🟦 | 1 d | `view.newGroup` etc. landed v3; more keyboard tiling missing |
| 6 | Dockview upstream `#1305` + `#1306` | ⏳ | — | Awaiting upstream |

## Messaging & UX

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| 2 | Library → Issues tab | ⬜ | 1 d | `gh` CLI adapter; G1 |
| 3 | Library → Pull Requests tab | ⬜ | 1 d | G1 |
| 4 | Library → Gists tab | ⬜ | 1 d | G1; pairs with `/share gist` |

| 10 | `/diff` session changes panel | ⬜ | 1 d | |
| 11 | Pin to Notes sidebar / Notes sidebar | ⬜ | — | Deferred |
| 12 | Theme picker (colorblind variants) | 🟦 | 1 d | Light/dark only today |
| 13 | Fix light mode (visual bugs / contrast / unstyled areas) | ⬜ | 1 d | User-flagged 2026-05-27. Dark is the default-tested path; light mode has not been audited recently — likely missing tokens / PrimeVue overrides / per-component themes. |

## Projects, accounts, persistence

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Project model + per-project settings overlay | ⬜ | 3 d | "Projects" concept; unblocks 2 + 3 + per-project autopilot policy |
| 2 | Multi-account auth (OS-keyring) | ⬜ | 3 d | One account today; no per-session pin |
| 3 | Per-session MCP overlay | ⬜ | — | Depends on project model |
| 4 | Per-project MCP overlay | ⬜ | — | Depends on project model |
| 5 | Idle timeout configurable per session | ⬜ | 0.5 d | SDK supports; no UI |

## Skills, agents, automations

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`/agent <name>` actually selects the agent** | ⬜ | 1 d | User-flagged 2026-05-27. Today `/agent` just opens the Library Agents tab (`sessionCommands.ts:136-143`). No autocomplete on agent names, no parameter handling, no actual selection. MANUAL_TESTS.md:1110 already documents this. Needs: typeahead listing agents from `rpc.agent.list`; on Enter, call `rpc.agent.select(sessionId, name)`. |
| 2 | **`/skill <name>` actually runs the skill** | ⬜ | 1 d | Same shape as above. Today `/skill` / `/skills` just open the Library Skills tab. Needs: typeahead from `rpc.skills.list`; on Enter, invoke the skill in the active session. Pairs with item 4 below ("Skills as `/skill-name` slash typeahead"). |
| 3 | **`/mcp <server>` operations** | ⬜ | 1 d | Today `/mcp` just opens the Library MCP tab. Need to scope: maybe `/mcp enable <server>` / `/mcp disable <server>` / `/mcp restart <server>` per server. Or just kill the slash if Library tab is the right UX. Decide in spec interview. |
| 4 | ~~"Select" button in LibraryAgentsTab~~ | ✅ | — | Shipped (commit pending). Per-row Select/Deselect button + "Selected" chip + left-rail accent on the current agent. Reuses `useSessionAgents` so state stays in sync with `SessionDetailsPanel`. |
| 5 | Skills as `/skill-name` slash typeahead | ⬜ | 1 d | Local-commands path exists; SDK skills not routed |
| 6 | Agents / fleets full panel | 🟦 | 2 d | Picker + sub-agent block exist; no fleet panel |
| 7 | Scheduled prompts (cron) | ⬜ | 2 d | None today |
| 8 | File / time / manual / webhook triggers | ⬜ | 3 d | |
| 9 | Activity feed (Settings → Activity) | ⬜ | 1 d | |
| 10 | Quiet hours / batching / digest | ⬜ | 1 d | Notifications polish |
| 11 | Background task notifications | ⬜ | 0.5 d | |
| 12 | `/research`, `/init`, `/review`, `/delegate` | ⬜ | — | |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cmd palette prefix syntax (`>` / `@` / `:` / `category:query`) | ⬜ | 0.5 d | Deferred from 2026-05-27 palette polish sprint; user chose to ship sub-menus + settings coverage first |
| 2 | Configurable shortcut system | ⬜ | 2 d | User-requested; up next after palette polish |
| 3 | Full search of sessions and content | ⬜ | 3 d | User-requested |
| 4 | `/changelog` viewer | ⬜ | 0.5 d | |
| 5 | `/instructions` toggle picker | ⬜ | 1 d | Library Instructions tab is read-only |
| 6 | `/statusline` config | ⬜ | 1 d | StatusBar exists; no per-statusline config |
| 7 | System prompt customize mode (10 named sections) | ⬜ | 2 d | |
| 8 | Custom request headers per turn | ⬜ | 1 d | |
| 9 | Model capabilities override | ⬜ | 1 d | |

| 2 | Azure DevOps work items / PRs | ⬜ | 3 d | User-requested |
| 3 | M365 integration | ⬜ | — | A9 |
| 4 | Teams bot | ⬜ | — | A10; depends on Server mode |
| 5 | Server mode (Dafman over browser) | 🟨 | 4 d | `wsBridge.ts` exists; no server wrapper |

## Observability

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Metrics counters / histograms in Settings | ⬜ | 1 d | M2 def-of-done |
| 2 | Per-MCP-server metrics | ⬜ | 1 d | |

## Testing & CI

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Real-Electrobun Tier-4 (CDP) harness | ⬜ | 3 d | Drive the actual built binary. Hard. Tier-3 extensions shipped 2026-05-27 cover the v3 bug class. |
| 2 | Real-DockviewComponent harness across all v3 tests | 🟦 | 1 d | Used in `composePersistLayout` tests only |
| 3 | Real-DockviewComponent in `bootLayout` tests | ⬜ | 1 d | |

## Tech-debt remaining

These are the items left after the 20c / 21a / 21b / 21c / 21d sprints.
History in `_archive/plan-tech-debt.prompt.md`.

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `dafman.pending_request` event payload cast (T2) | ⏸️ deferred | Line noise vs. safety win |
| 2 | SessionDetailsPanel cohesion (U4) | ⏸️ deferred | ~1100 LoC, threshold 1500 |
| 3 | `enqueuePending` silent cancel on emit failure (U5) | ⏸️ deferred | Rubber-duck confirmed current shape is correct |
| 4 | Dev-only suspicious deps (D3) | flag-only | |
| 5 | Native Go type-checker (typescript-go) (D4) | ⏳ upstream | |

## User-reported manual-test bugs (2026-05-27 sweep of MANUAL_TESTS.md notes)

These are issues the user has manually verified during dogfooding and embedded as
`Note:` lines in `MANUAL_TESTS.md`. They are real, reproducible bugs — not hypotheticals.

| # | Item | Status | Effort | Receipt in MANUAL_TESTS.md |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jobs panel spinner orbits a center point (visual jank); Go-to-session scrolls to top instead of the relevant message | ⬜ | 1 d | line 293-295 |
| 2 | Plan-mode toggle doesn't actually switch to plan mode | ⬜ | 1 d | line 375 |
| 3 | Skills tab doesn't recognize skills from `.github/skills` | ⬜ | 1 d | line 706 |
| 4 | MCP **HTTP transport / OAuth** UI: "No such option" — the Sign-in / HTTP transport form doesn't render | ⬜ | 1 d | line 781 |
| 5 | Toggling **discovered MCPs** doesn't persist / do anything; discovered servers should be editable / deletable / show location | ⬜ | 1 d | line 797-798 |
| 6 | Removing a configured MCP "jumps to discovered" — confusing UX | ⬜ | 0.5 d | line 805 |
| 7 | **No Sign-in button at all** on configured HTTP MCP servers | ⬜ | 0.5 d | line 812 |
| 8 | Agent card missing an **Edit button** (only reveal / delete) | ⬜ | 0.5 d | line 1100 |
| 9 | Pressing Tab on the `/fleet` slash menu should insert into composer (so you can add the description), not commit immediately | ⬜ | 0.5 d | line 1196 |
| 10 | Sub-agent block emits raw `<system_notification>` text instead of parsed events into the nested card | ⬜ | 1 d | line 1205-1210 |

## Open product questions

- GPT-5.5 `reasoning_opaque` decryption — what does the wire payload contain after decryption?
- Groups vs Projects boundary — Projects is now spec'd as "per-cwd settings overlay" but the boundary needs a final stake driven during Projects implementation
- Plugin / theme system surface
- End-user docs site

## What to do when you finish something

1. Move the row from here to [`DONE.md`](DONE.md) under the matching topic.
2. If you changed architecture or an invariant: also update [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).
3. If a manual test was relevant: append a section to `MANUAL_TESTS.md`.
4. Update `STATUS.md` if it was a milestone item.
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` if user-visible.
