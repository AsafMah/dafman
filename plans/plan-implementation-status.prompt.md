# Master implementation-status audit (2026-05-27)

> Cross-referenced sweep of EVERY feature/idea in the project against
> the current codebase. Sources: `plans/plan-backlog-audit.prompt.md`,
> `plans/plan-roadmap.prompt.md`, `plans/plan-sdk-audit.prompt.md`,
> `STATUS.md`, this session's conversation, all 50+ DEVLOG entries.
>
> Status legend:
>
> - ✅ **DONE** — shipped and exercised in code; one file path cited as receipt
> - 🟦 **PARTIAL** — code exists for the core but a documented sub-feature is missing
> - 🟨 **STARTED / PLANNED** — design exists; some scaffolding shipped; not user-visible yet
> - ⬜ **NOT STARTED** — listed in plans, no code yet
> - 🟥 **REVERTED** — was shipped and rolled back; counts as not-started until re-attempted

## Quick stats

- ✅ DONE: 70+
- 🟦 PARTIAL: ~12
- 🟨 STARTED / PLANNED: ~4
- ⬜ NOT STARTED: ~80
- 🟥 REVERTED: 2 (groups v1 + v2 — both superseded by v3 ✅)

**Highest-value gaps right now (by frequency-of-mention × user-visible-impact):**

1. ⬜ Real-Electrobun E2E harness (would catch the v3 bug class)
2. ⬜ G4 — Groups v3.1 polish (Move-to-group menu, rename, color picker)
3. ⬜ Phase 27 — Multi-account + BYOK (lots of internal demand)
4. ⬜ Phase 29 — Projects (resolves the "groups vs projects" open question)
5. ⬜ Phase 31 — Diff viewer with accept/reject hunks
6. ⬜ G1 — GitHub `#` mentions + Issues/PRs/Gists tabs
7. ⬜ Phase 30 — Memory backend
8. ⬜ Phase 33 — Automations + scheduler
